# FoodFlix

### Claire Muller & Chhaian Pin

Welcome to our Mod 1 project! FoodFlix is a command line recipe search that allows a user to search for recipes by an ingredient and save them to their favorites list.

### As a user, I want to:
* enter an ingredient and get a list of recipes that use that ingredient
* add or remove recipes from my favorites
* retrieve my favorite recipes
* view the most favorited recipes in order
* get recommended recipes based on my favorites

## Installation
1. clone this repository
2. run bundle install to install the necessary gems
3. run ruby bin/run.db to start!
